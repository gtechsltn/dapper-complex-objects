Advantages of Output Parameters

Using output parameters with Dapper allows developers to access data from databases safely and efficiently while taking full advantage of the power of stored procedures. Output parameters can also be used to return multiple resultsets or structured data in one go.

The output parameters let you handle the results of a stored procedure. It allows you to change your output type and structure without modifying existing code. You can also use it to return multiple result sets or an output parameter with different types like INT, VARCHAR, and DECIMAL.

That makes Dapper output parameters an extremely powerful tool that can help you quickly and easily create dynamic, complex queries with minimal effort.
